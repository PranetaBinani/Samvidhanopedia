        <h2>Real Law</h2>
        <p>The Special Marriage Act, 1954 is an act of the Parliament of India with provision for secular civil marriage (or "registered marriage") for people of India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries, irrelevant of the religion or faith followed (both for inter-religious couples and also for atheists and agnostics) by either party.[1] The Act originated from a piece of legislation proposed during the late 19th century. Marriages solemnized under Special Marriage Act are not governed by personal laws and are considered to be secular.[2]</p>
